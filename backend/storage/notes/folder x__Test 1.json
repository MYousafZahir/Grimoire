  "content": "Breakfast is the first meal of the day. It is usually eaten in the morning. The word comes from two other words; \"break\" (\"end\") and fast (\"not eating for a long time\").\n\nDefinition: [1463] from break (v.) + fast (n.). Cf. Fr. d\u00e9jeuner \"to breakfast,\" from L. dis-jejunare \"to break the fast.\"\n\nPeople around the world eat different things for breakfast:\n\nIn the United States, people usually eat pancakes, waffles, toast, eggs or bagels for breakfast.\nIn Canada, people usually eat maple cured bacon, fried potatoes, maple-infused beans, eggs, toast, pancakes and maple syrup or hot oatmeal for breakfast.\nIn the United Kingdom a large breakfast was often, and still is sometimes, served. Usually this would be bread, tea, egg, bacon, ham, fruits, baked beans on toast and sometimes vegetables. This pattern of heavy eating has greatly changed in recent years. Most people do not do manual work nowadays.[1]\nIn France, people usually eat a very light meal; often bread and coffee with milk. Again, this depends on what kind of work is done (usually by the father of the household).\nIn Asia, most people eat rice instead of bread. They also sometimes eat porridge."
