# Welcome to Grimoire

This is your first note in Grimoire, a semantic notes app for macOS.

## What is Grimoire?

Grimoire is a note-taking application that automatically creates semantic links between your notes. Unlike traditional note-taking apps that require manual linking, Grimoire analyzes the content of your notes and finds connections for you.

## Key Features

### Semantic Backlinks
As you type, Grimoire searches through all your notes to find semantically related content. These "backlinks" appear in real-time, showing you connections you might not have noticed.

### Excerpt-Level Linking
Instead of just linking to entire notes, Grimoire can link to specific passages within notes. This allows for more precise connections between ideas.

### Nested Hierarchy
Organize your notes in a tree structure. Create parent notes, child notes, and build a knowledge base that matches your thinking.

### Markdown Support
Write in markdown for rich formatting. Grimoire supports all standard markdown syntax.

## Getting Started

1. **Create a new note** by clicking the "+" button in the sidebar
2. **Start typing** - backlinks will appear automatically
3. **Click on backlinks** to jump to related content
4. **Use markdown** for formatting (headers, lists, bold, italic, etc.)

## Example Structure

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Write naturally** - Grimoire works best when you write in complete sentences
- **Use descriptive titles** - This helps with organization and search
- **Don't worry about linking** - The semantic engine handles connections automatically
- **Review backlinks regularly** - They can reveal unexpected connections between ideas

## Privacy

All your data stays on your machine. Grimoire doesn't send anything to the cloud - the semantic search happens locally using sentence-transformers and FAISS.
