# Manual Semantic Backlinks Evaluation (30 Cursor Cases)

This is a human review of the 30 stable cursor locations in `tests/backend/semantic_backlinks_sample_cases.json`, using the generated output in `tests/backend/semantic_backlinks_sample_report.md`.

Ratings:
- **Excellent**: directly useful, specific, and substantial.
- **Good**: relevant and useful; minor redundancy or slightly off-target item(s).
- **Mixed**: at least one useful hit, but noticeable off-topic/low-signal results.
- **Poor**: mostly off-topic or low-signal.

## Case Notes

1. **Good** — Workshop/industry ambience; results give adjacent craft/architecture passages; result 3 drifts to nightlife.
2. **Good** — Counting House / market core; results expand to Amber Market + governance + outer Sprawl context.
3. **Good** — “Greys” scholastic district; results reinforce discipline/quiet + alchemy/healing; result 3 (“Sprawl” ring) is tangential.
4. **Good** — Shattered-sky cosmology; results connect to Sorcery’s shattered-sky canon + falling stars; concise but relevant.
5. **Mixed** — “Canonical understanding” outro; results are mostly headings/summary bullets and don’t link out to the dedicated shattered-sky note.
6. **Excellent** — Necropolis/cemetery operations; all 3 results are strong, concrete, and on-topic.
7. **Good** — Greys district “emptiness”; 2 strong Greys excerpts; result 3 again drifts to Lantern Quarter.
8. **Mixed** — Cedar Court governance; top result is perfect; results 2–3 drift into other districts (nightlife + Greys) without clear need.
9. **Good** — Monastery dome/echo/Pit; Pit excerpt is excellent; result 2 (Greys) is off-topic; result 3 (Monastery summary) is thin but relevant.
10. **Good** — Essence usage; excerpts cover artifacts-as-interface and essence training; lich artifact excerpt is slightly adjacent but still tied to “essence → artifact”.
11. **Good** — Voluntary return / rule against turning; results hit the core “don’t turn” boundary + Carrion definition; result 3 is meta-summary (still relevant).
12. **Excellent** — Necropolis block; all 3 are directly supporting detail and high-signal.
13. **Excellent** — Shattered sky + “stars are sorcerers”; Sorcery canon excerpt is highly aligned; the note’s own shard-climate paragraph is a perfect match.
14. **Good** — Lich cannibalism internal process; results 1–2 are excellent; result 3 (essence training) is less direct but still about technique limits.
15. **Good** — Soots workshop district; results provide nearby “balconies/apprentices” + “hammers/smoke” support; result 3 is a Greys excerpt (weak).
16. **Mixed** — Gendered artifact/spell roles; results are generic artifact/craft training excerpts rather than the dimorphism examples.
17. **Good** — Ratways usage/trade; Ratways excerpts are excellent; Ibnasi market excerpt is plausible as “Ibnasi context” but not specifically about Ratway mapping.
18. **Mixed** — Gendered artifact roles (female/male); same issue as Case 16: supportive but not specifically dimorphism-focused.
19. **Good** — District list → Amber Market; results expand to Counting House + other districts; all are usable.
20. **Good** — Lich cannibalism limits; results 1–2 stay tightly on lich motivation/interface; result 3 (training) is less direct.
21. **Excellent** — Carrion description; all 3 excerpts are tightly aligned and high-signal.
22. **Good** — “Room voices” + risk; results return “don’t turn” + Carrion definition; meta-summary is acceptable but repetitive.
23. **Excellent** — Lantern Quarter; results 1–2 are vivid, useful; result 3 is Cedar Court garden (minor drift).
24. **Good** — Monastery/Pit; results 1–2 give summary + dome detail; result 3 drifts to Greys architecture.
25. **Excellent** — Sample Aether Foundry; results connect to Lumen Court licensing + foundry politics + Shattered sky source note.
26. **Good** — Obtaining Essences / Trading Guild; results correctly surface Trading Guild scarcity + liminal-room entry; result 2 (essence training) is mildly adjacent.
27. **Good** — Magemaker questioning / liminal-room; results focus on the “don’t turn” boundary + Carrion; meta-summary is repetitive but on-topic.
28. **Good** — Essence definition; results cover artifact interface + training; lich excerpt is adjacent but still artifact/essence-linked.
29. **Good** — Transition into artifacts section; results focus on Carrion boundary and Carrion definition; feels repetitive but still relevant to the cursor window.
30. **Excellent** — “I am a lie” Magemaker framing; all 3 excerpts reinforce the exact philosophical constraint and warning.
